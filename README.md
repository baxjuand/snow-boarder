Snow Boarder

Overview

Snow Boarder is a fast-paced, browser-based game where you snowboard across a level, performing aerial spins and escaping a growing snowball. The goal is to reach the finish line without hitting your head, whether you’re landing from a jump or descending a snow hill. This project was developed as part of my game development learning journey.
